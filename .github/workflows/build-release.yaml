# DEPRECATED: This workflow has been replaced by the new CI/CD architecture:
# - build.yml (unsigned builds for all environments)
# - sign-test.yml (signs untrusted PR builds with test key)
# - sign-release.yml (signs production builds with release key)
#
# This workflow is kept temporarily for backward compatibility and will be removed.
# See docs/VERSIONING.md for the new signing architecture documentation.
